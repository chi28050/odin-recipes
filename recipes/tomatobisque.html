    <h4>You won't even need vine-ripened tomatoes!</h4>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 cup diced onion</li>
        <li>½ cup diced celery</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>1 (32 ounce) container chicken broth, or more as needed</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed San Marzano tomatoes</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 pinch freshly ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons uncooked jasmine rice</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar, or to taste</li>
        <li>½ cup heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons heavy whipping cream, divided</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons thinly sliced fresh basil leaves, divided</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat; cook and stir onion and celery with a pinch of salt until onion is translucent, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Pour chicken broth and tomatoes into onion mixture. Bring to a simmer and season with paprika, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Turn heat to low and stir rice into soup; skim foam occasionally and simmer until rice and vegetables are very tender, 35 to 45 minutes. Add sugar.</li>
        <li>Blend soup with an immersion blender in the pot until smooth. Whisk 1/2 cup cream into soup and season with salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and sugar if needed. If soup is too thick, add more broth; if soup is too thin, cook, stirring often, until reduced and slightly thickened, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Ladle into warmed bowls; garnish each bowl with a drizzle of cream and top each with about 1 teaspoon chopped basil.</li>
    </ol>
